		   	<h3 ><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government College of Technology, Coimbatore was founded in 1945 as Arthur Hope College of Technology named after Arthur Hope, Governor of Madras Presidency (1940–46) by G. D. Naidu. The College was modelled after the then famous Germany’s technical institutions with inputs by Stoll family and Hermann Weiler. Till 1950 the college functioned in Peelamedu, then a suburb of Coimbatore.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1950, the college moved to its current location in Thadagam Road, Coimbatore. In 1951, the college was renamed as Government College of Technology (GCT). The college was initially affiliated to the University of Madras, later to the Bharathiar University and since the academic year 2001-2002 to Anna University. In 1981, the college was granted autonomy for its civil and mechanical engineering postgraduate programs. Subsequently, in 1987, full autonomy for all programs was granted.
